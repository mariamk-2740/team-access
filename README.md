# CONNECTA

###### If youâ€™re interested in continuing development for CONNECTA, here are the steps to do so:


1. Clone the repository onto your local computer
2. Start Development! 
    1. We used Microsoft Visual Studio Code as our code editor.
    2. To host your website on a local server and see your code changes, use the following command on the terminal: **npm run start**
    3. We would highly recommend you to refer to the [INFO340: Client-Side Development textbook](https://docs.google.com/document/d/14p2xK0stM0UuhrO-tCCwGMLYLxWhm1rNILeiZeFaTJE/edit) to refresh your knowledge of web development.
4. Add and push any necessary code changes to the Git repository.
5. Host and deploy your project! 
    1. We recommend setting up a new Firebase project and hosting your project there as you might not have access to the current firebase project we have our site hosted on.
    2. In order to do that, you will need to change the [firebaseConfig variable value in the index.js](https://github.com/mariamk-2740/team-access/blob/main/connect-ta/src/index.js)
